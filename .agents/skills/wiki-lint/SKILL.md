# Wiki Lint — Health Audit

You are performing a health check on an Obsidian wiki. Your goal is to find and fix structural issues that degrade the wiki's value over time.

**Before scanning anything:** follow the Retrieval Primitives table in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`. Prefer frontmatter-scoped greps and section-anchored reads over full-page reads. On a large vault, blindly reading every page to lint it is exactly what this framework is built to avoid.

## Before You Start

1. Read `.env` to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Read `index.md` for the full page inventory
3. Read `log.md` for recent activity context

## Lint Checks

Run these checks in order. Report findings as you go.

### 1. Orphaned Pages

Find pages with zero incoming wikilinks. These are knowledge islands that nothing connects to.

**How to check:**
- Glob all `.md` files in the vault
- For each page, Grep the rest of the vault for `[[page-name]]` references
- Pages with zero incoming links (except `index.md` and `log.md`) are orphans

**How to fix:**
- Identify which existing pages should link to the orphan
- Add wikilinks in appropriate sections

### 2. Broken Wikilinks

Find `[[wikilinks]]` that point to pages that don't exist.

**How to check:**
- Grep for `\[\[.*?\]\]` across all pages
- Extract the link targets
- Check if a corresponding `.md` file exists

**How to fix:**
- If the target was renamed, update the link
- If the target should exist, create it
- If the link is wrong, remove or correct it

### 3. Missing Frontmatter

Every page should have: title, category, tags, sources, created, updated.

**How to check:**
- Grep frontmatter blocks (scope to `^---` at file heads) instead of reading every page in full
- Flag pages missing required fields

**How to fix:**
- Add missing fields with reasonable defaults

### 3a. Missing Summary (soft warning)

Every page *should* have a `summary:` frontmatter field — 1–2 sentences, ≤200 chars. This is what cheap retrieval (e.g. `wiki-query`'s index-only mode) reads to avoid opening page bodies.

**How to check:**
- Grep frontmatter for `^summary:` across the vault
- Flag pages without it, **but as a soft warning, not an error** — older pages predating this field are fine; the check exists to nudge ingest skills into filling it on new writes.
- Also flag pages whose summary exceeds 200 chars.

**How to fix:**
- Re-ingest the page, or manually write a short summary (1–2 sentences of the page's content).

### 4. Stale Content

Pages whose `updated` timestamp is old relative to their sources.

**How to check:**
- Compare page `updated` timestamps to source file modification times
- Flag pages where sources have been modified after the page was last updated

### 5. Contradictions

Claims that conflict across pages.

**How to check:**
- This requires reading related pages and comparing claims
- Focus on pages that share tags or are heavily cross-referenced
- Look for phrases like "however", "in contrast", "despite" that may signal existing acknowledged contradictions vs. unacknowledged ones

**How to fix:**
- Add an "Open Questions" section noting the contradiction
- Reference both sources and their claims

### 6. Index Consistency

Verify `index.md` matches the actual page inventory.

**How to check:**
- Compare pages listed in `index.md` to actual files on disk
- Check that summaries in `index.md` still match page content

### 7. Provenance Drift

Check whether pages are being honest about how much of their content is inferred vs extracted. See the Provenance Markers section in `llm-wiki` for the convention.

**How to check:**
- For each page with a `provenance:` block or any `^[inferred]`/`^[ambiguous]` markers, count sentences/bullets and how many end with each marker
- Compute rough fractions (`extracted`, `inferred`, `ambiguous`)
- Apply these thresholds:
  - **AMBIGUOUS > 15%**: flag as "speculation-heavy" — even 1-in-7 claims being genuinely uncertain is a signal the page needs tighter sourcing or should be moved to `synthesis/`
  - **INFERRED > 40% with no `sources:` in frontmatter**: flag as "unsourced synthesis" — the page is making connections but has nothing to cite
  - **Hub pages** (top 10 by incoming wikilink count) with INFERRED > 20%: flag as "high-traffic page with questionable provenance" — errors on hub pages propagate to every page that links to them
  - **Drift**: if the page has a `provenance:` frontmatter block, flag it when any field is more than 0.20 off from the recomputed value
- **Skip** pages with no `provenance:` frontmatter and no markers — treated as fully extracted by convention

**How to fix:**
- For ambiguous-heavy: re-ingest from sources, resolve the uncertain claims, or split speculative content into a `synthesis/` page
- For unsourced synthesis: add `sources:` to frontmatter or clearly label the page as synthesis
- For hub pages with INFERRED > 20%: prioritize for re-ingestion — errors here have the widest blast radius
- For drift: update the `provenance:` frontmatter to match the recomputed values

### 8. Fragmented Tag Clusters

Checks whether pages that share a tag are actually linked to each other. Tags imply a topic cluster; if those pages don't reference each other, the cluster is fragmented — knowledge islands that should be woven together.

**How to check:**
- For each tag that appears on ≥ 5 pages:
  - `n` = count of pages with this tag
  - `actual_links` = count of wikilinks between any two pages in this tag group (check both directions)
  - `cohesion = actual_links / (n × (n−1) / 2)`
- Flag any tag group where cohesion < 0.15 and n ≥ 5

**How to fix:**
- Run the `cross-linker` skill targeted at the fragmented tag — it will surface and insert the missing links
- If a tag group is large (n > 15) and still fragmented, consider splitting it into more specific sub-tags

### 9. Visibility Tag Consistency

Checks that `visibility/` tags are applied correctly and aren't silently missing where they matter.

**How to check:**

- **Untagged PII patterns:** Grep page bodies for patterns that commonly indicate sensitive data — lines containing `password`, `api_key`, `secret`, `token`, `ssn`, `email:`, `phone:` followed by an actual value (not a field description). If a page matches and lacks `visibility/pii` or `visibility/internal`, flag it as a likely mis-classification.
- **`visibility/pii` without `sources:`:** A page tagged `visibility/pii` should always have a `sources:` frontmatter field — if there's no provenance, there's no way to verify the classification. Flag any `visibility/pii` page missing `sources:`.
- **Visibility tags in taxonomy:** `visibility/` tags are system tags and must **not** appear in `_meta/taxonomy.md`. If found there, flag as misconfigured — they'd be counted toward the 5-tag limit on pages that include them.

**How to fix:**
- For untagged PII patterns: add `visibility/pii` (or `visibility/internal` if it's team-context rather than personal data) to the page's frontmatter tags
- For missing `sources:`: add provenance or escalate to the user — don't auto-fill
- For taxonomy contamination: remove the `visibility/` entries from `_meta/taxonomy.md`

### 10. Misc Promotion Candidates

Find pages in `misc/` that have accumulated enough project affinity to be promoted.

**How to check:**
- Glob `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/misc/*.md`
- For each page, read the `affinity` frontmatter field
- Flag pages where any single project's score ≥ 3

**How to fix:**
- Run the `cross-linker` skill first if affinity scores look stale (e.g., `affinity: {}` on a page with many wikilinks)
- To promote: move the page to `projects/<project-name>/references/` (or another appropriate category), update its `category` frontmatter, remove `promotion_status`, and grep the vault for backlinks to update them

### 11. Synthesis Gaps

Identify high-value synthesis opportunities the wiki is missing — concept pairs that co-occur across many pages but have no `synthesis/` page connecting them.

**How to check:**
- List all pages in `synthesis/` — collect the concept pairs each one already covers (from its `[[wikilinks]]` or title)
- Pick 10-15 frequently linked concepts from `concepts/` and `entities/`
- For each pair, run a quick grep to count pages that link to both:
  ```bash
  grep -rl "\[\[ConceptA\]\]" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --include="*.md" > /tmp/a.txt
  grep -rl "\[\[ConceptB\]\]" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --include="*.md" > /tmp/b.txt
  comm -12 <(sort /tmp/a.txt) <(sort /tmp/b.txt) | wc -l
  ```
- Flag pairs with co-occurrence ≥ 3 that have no existing synthesis page

**How to fix:**
- Run `/wiki-synthesize` to automatically discover and fill the top gaps
